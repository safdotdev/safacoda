## Workshop Prerequisites

- Nothing! Just you and a bit of time

## Goals

See how a language implementation can interact with the [Pact FFI](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/tree/master/rust/pact_ffi#pact-ffi), and create up to V4 specification pact files, and interact with the [pact-plugin](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-plugins/) ecosystem

You will:

1. See a Pact implementation, using Rust FFI (Ruby for the lolz)
   1. See a http v3 Pact test and pact file
   2. See a message v3 Pact test and pact file
   3. See a http v4 test and pact file
   4. See an async message v4 Pact test, tested with the [pact-protobuf-plugin](https://github.com/pactflow/pact-protobuf-plugin) and corresponding pact file
   5. See a working codebase to get some ideas of how it hangs together
