## Workshop Prerequisites

- Nothing! Just you and a bit of time

## Goals

See how a language implementation can interact with the Pact FFI, and create up to V4 specification pact files, and interact with the pact-plugin ecosystem

You will:

1. See a Pact implementation, using Rust FFI (Ruby for the lolz)
   1. See a http v3 Pact test and pact file
   2. See a message v3 Pact test and pact file
   3. See a http v4 test and pact file
   4. See a async message v4 Pact test, tested with the pact-protobuf-plugin and corresponding pact file
   5. See a working codebase to get some ideas of how it hangs together
