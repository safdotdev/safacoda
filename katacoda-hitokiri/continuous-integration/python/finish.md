There are numerous, complementing, and competing ways to implement what you just learned here. You may be overwhelmed with [decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) while trying to invest in the best choice. Consider that Tekton with Kaniko is helping to standardize the language and architecture of pipelines that leverage the existing [benefits of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/#why-you-need-kubernetes-and-what-can-it-do).

This tutorial shows how you can easily use Kubernetes as the underlying platform for running Tekton-based Pipelines. CI/CD is a great place for your team to start understanding how to leverage the distributed and high availability nature of Kubernetes.

In addition, there are various ways to write a microservice in Python and a few techniques to package it all in a container. The goal in this scenario is to press some good practices for distilling a container and effectively delivering a microservice to Kubernetes.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these steps, you have learned:

- &#x2714; How to use FastAPI for developing a Python microservice
- &#x2714; How to distill a container that packages Python
- &#x2714; How to install a private registry with a UI
- &#x2714; How to define, run, and observe a Tekton pipeline
- &#x2714; How to build a container with Kaniko
