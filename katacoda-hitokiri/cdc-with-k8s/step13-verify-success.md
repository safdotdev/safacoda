Rebuild the new container with an increased SemVer number. We bump the patch value, since it's a bug fix.

`./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=localhost:5000/$(basename $PWD):0.0.2`{{execute}}

Push the corrected container image to the private registry on your Kubernetes cluster.

`docker push localhost:5000/$(basename $PWD):0.0.2`{{execute}}

Patch the current deployment to use the new container version.

`kubectl patch deployment aggregator -p \
  '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"aggregator","image":"localhost:5000/aggregator:0.0.2"}]}}}}'`{{execute}}

Verify a new Pod has been started.

`kubectl get pods,deployments,services -l app=$(basename $PWD)`{{execute}}

Finally, run the pactVerify task again and let's see if that bug has been squashed.

`./gradlew pactVerify`{{execute}}
